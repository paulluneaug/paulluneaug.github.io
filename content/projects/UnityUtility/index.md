## Project Description

UnityUtility is a package containing collection of tools and utility functions for Unity. {{< br >}}
I started this project in 2023 and keep adding features in parallel with the other projects I am working on, as and when I need them for those projects.

It mainly contains :

- Many attributes, inspired by [Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/), to customize the inspector
- Extension methods
- Pools
- Serializable dictionary
- Base classes for singletons
- And many more

## What I learned

This project allowed me to learn a lot about the Unity editor and its programming interface. {{< br >}}
It also helps me in most of my other projets, saving me from having to rewrite the same code over and over and helping me iterate faster.
