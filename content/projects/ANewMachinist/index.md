## Presentation

A New Machinist is a game we created as a **team of eight** plus the help of two as part of our **final project** for our first year of master's degree.

In this game, you play the role of a puppeteer candidate at a puppet theatre. Learn how to use your console to control the stage and follow the director's instructions or improvise based on the elements you give him.

The original experience is played with a **physical console** that we built. It features no less than 17 buttons, 9 switches, 3 rotary encoders, 3 potentiometers, 4 faders (one of which is motorised) and 22 LED indicators!

## Technical overview

For this project, I was in charge of :

- Crafting the console and interfacing it with Unity
- Programming the UI and some of the gameplay elements
- Helping to implement the dialogue and act integration tool

### Languages used

This project was created using **Unity** and therefore used **C#** as well as **C++** and **C** for the Arduino code.

### The console

![Console](images/Console.jpg)

One of the main challenge in this project was to craft from scratch a working console and to connect it with Unity as I had little experience with elecronics.

The finished console works quite well thanks to the time I put into it, but I hope I never have to fix the mess underneath.
