## About the game

**NeomarsXIII** takes you to a neo-futuristic Marseille, called Neo-Massilia. You play as a rookie **pétanque** player. Explore the city and fight some of the best pétanque players controlling the place in a game of futuristic pétanque, now enhanced with new rules !

## Technical overview

For this game, I was the lead programmer (insofar as one can speak of a lead programmer in the context of a student project) and my duties were :

- Creating and maintaining the overall architecture of the game, while ensuring that the code for each phase of gameplay is as separate as possible
- Implementing the petanque gameplay loop
- Creating an opposing player that could aim precisely at targets
- Integrating assets (sounds, animations, UI, 3D assets...)
- Proposing and enforcing coding standards to ensure consistency in the source code
- Reviewing code and pull requests on GitHub to make sure the project stays clean
- Helping the other programmers of the project
- Assisting with VFXs and shaders
