## Pitch

Uncannycal Girls is a two-player cooperative shmup (shoot-'em-up). Each player takes control of a magical-girl-like angel tasked with defeating a visibly hostile fleet of spaceships.

The game is a school project and was made with a team of 10 in about a week.

## My contribution

During this project, I mostly was in charge of the level structure, the enemy wave system, and a tool to allow the game designers to edit the levels easily.
